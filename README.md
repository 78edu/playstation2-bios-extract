PLEASE READ!
<br>
WORK IN PROGRESS, 16 BYTE PADDING IS NOT IMPLEMENTED (WILL BE, IT'S SIMPLE)
<br>
ALL MODULES OFFSETS AFTER ROMDIR SHOULD BE MOVED LITTLE BIT FORWARD
<br>
but for now this script can help with manual extraction
<br>
<br>
Modules extraction from PS2 rom dump
<br>
1.rename romfile as rom.bin
<br>
2.run script and type module number to extract
<br>
(you will see all modules list and offsets)
