# playstation2-bios-extract
PLEASE READ!
WORK IN PROGRESS, 16 BYTE PADDING IS NOT IMPLEMENTED (WILL BE, IT'S SIMPLE)
ALL MODULES OFFSETS AFTER ROMDIR SHOULD BE MOVED LITTLE BIT FORWARD
but for now this script can help with manual extraction

Modules extraction from PS2 rom dump

1.rename romfile as rom.bin
2.run script and type module number to extract
(you will see all modules list and offsets)
